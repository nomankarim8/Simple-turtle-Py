# Recursive Star Pattern with Turtle Graphics

This project demonstrates how to use the Python `turtle` graphics library to draw a recursive star pattern. The pattern is drawn using a series of smaller stars within a larger star, creating a fractal-like design.

## Project Structure

- **main.py**: The main script containing the code to draw the recursive star pattern.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine along with the `turtle` module. The `turtle` module is a standard Python library, so no additional installation is usually required. However, if you're using an environment that doesn't include `turtle`, you can install it using:

```bash
pip install PythonTurtle
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script file.
2. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. The program will open a window and display the recursive star pattern.

## Code Explanation

The main components of the code are:

- **Setup**: The turtle is initialized, and the screen background is set to black.

- **Drawing the Star**: The `star` function is a recursive function that draws a star pattern. It takes a turtle object and a size as parameters. The function draws a star, then calls itself with a smaller size to draw smaller stars at each point.

- **Color and Speed**: The turtle's color is set to yellow, and the drawing speed is set to 25 for a faster rendering.

## Customization

- **Color**: You can change the color of the star by modifying the `a.color("yellow")` line in the code.

- **Size**: The size of the initial star can be adjusted by changing the argument passed to the `star` function.

- **Position**: The starting position of the turtle can be changed by modifying the `a.goto(-200, 100)` line.
